# Pokemon


# This project is to fetch list of pokemon and display the details of the pokemon from pokemon API

Introduction
------------

The application uses Clean Architecture based on MVVM and Repository patterns. Implemented
Architecture principles follow Google recommended [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide).

The application is written entirely in Kotlin.

Android Jetpack is used as an Architecture glue including but not limited to ViewModel, LiveData,
Lifecycles, Navigation, Data Binding. See a complete list in "Libraries used" section.

The application does network HTTP requests via Retrofit, OkHttp and GSON.
Paging library is used for data pagination online

RxJava 2 manage background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.

Navigation component manages in-app navigation.

Dagger 2 is used for dependency injection.


A sample app consist of 2 screens: the list of the pokemon and pokemon full details.

Getting Started
---------------
This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
`gradlew build` command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

There is one Gradle tasks for testing the project:
* `test` - for running unit tests

Libraries Used
--------------

The application goal is to show case current Android Architecture state using out of box
Android tools made by Google (Android Jetpack) and 3rd party community driven libraries.

Android Jetpack is a set of components, tools and guidance to make great Android apps. They bring
together the existing Support Library and Architecture Components and arranges them into four
categories:

* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
  * [AppCompat][1] - Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android.
  * [Android KTX][2] - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
  * [Test][4] - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [Data Binding][11] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [Lifecycles][12] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
  * [LiveData][13] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Navigation][14] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
  * [ViewModel][17] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* [UI][30] - Details on why and how to use UI Components in your apps - together or separate.
  * [Layout][35] - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.
  * [Material][36] - Material Components.
* Third party
  * RxJava 2 for managing background threads with simplified code
     and reducing needs for callbacks.
  * [Dagger 2][92] A fast dependency injector.
  * [Retrofit 2][93] A configurable REST client.
  * [OkHttp 3][94] A type-safe HTTP client.
  * [GSON][95] A Json - Object converter using reflection.
  * [Glide][90] Image loading.
